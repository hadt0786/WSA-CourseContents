<!-- Write a Javascript program to design a nim game.
Description:
• Nim is a mathematical game of strategy in which two players take turns removing objects
from distinct heaps, which has following rules:
• There is a heap of stones on the table, each time one of you take turns to remove 1 to 3
stones.
• The one who removes the last stone will be the winner.
• You will take the first turn to remove the stones. Both of you are very clever and have
optimal strategies for the game. Continue the game until the last stone is removed.
• Special Case :
If there are 4 stones in the heap, then you will never win the game: no matter 1, 2, or 3
stones you remove, the last stone will always be removed by your friend.
Objective:
• To understand the concept of conditional operations in javascript.
Prerequisites:
• Conditional loop
Sample Execution:
Test Case 1:
Input: 5
Output : You won the game
Test Case 2:
Input: 4
Output : Your friend won the game -->
