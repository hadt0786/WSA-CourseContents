           <p style="text-align: justify">The Ninja 300 is based on the Ninja 250R, a lightweight and inexpensive sport bike in production for over three decades.[11] Like the Ninja 250R, it has a full fairing, but a wider rear tire, 140/70, than the instead of 130/70 on the 250R.[12] The Ninja 300 also has a LED tail lamp, 5 spoke wheels, neutral finder, and optional antilock braking system (ABS).[13][14]By comparison with the 250R, the Ninja 300 also has a slightly smaller fuel tank, taller gearing,[15] and a back-torque-limiting slipper clutch with an assist mechanism that decreases clutch lever effort.[4] Despite being a sport bike, it has comfortable ergonomics (such as windscreen effectively protecting from wind blast) which promotes commuting.[14]</p>
