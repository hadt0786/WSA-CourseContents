Abdul Rashid Salim Salman Khan (born 27 December 1965),[3] credited as Salman Khan (pronunciation: [səlˈmaːn ˈxaːn]) is an Indian film actor, producer, singer and television personality. In a film career spanning almost thirty years, Khan has received numerous awards, including two National Film Awards and two Filmfare Awards.[4] He has a significant following in Asia and the Indian diaspora worldwide, and is cited in the media as one of the most commercially successful actors of Indian cinema.[5][6]

The eldest son of screenwriter Salim Khan, Khan began his acting career with a supporting role in Biwi Ho To Aisi (1988) and achieved breakthrough with a leading role in his next release—Sooraj Barjatya's romance Maine Pyar Kiya (1989). Khan went on to establish himself in Bollywood in the 1990s with roles in several top-grossing productions, including the romantic drama Hum Aapke Hain Koun..! (1994), the action thriller Karan Arjun (1995), the comedy Biwi No.1 (1999), and the family drama Hum Saath-Saath Hain (1999). For his role in Karan Johar's romantic drama Kuch Kuch Hota Hai (1998), Khan was awarded the Filmfare Award for Best Supporting Actor. After a brief period of decline in the 2000s, Khan achieved greater stardom in the 2010s by playing the lead role in blockbuster action films with Dabangg (2010), Ready (2011) and Bodyguard (2011).

<p> He rose to prominence with series of action films Ek Tha Tiger (2012), Dabangg 2 (2012), Kick (2014), Prem Ratan Dhan Payo (2015), Bajrangi Bhaijaan (2015), Sultan (2016) and Tiger Zinda Hai (2017), all of which rank among the highest-grossing Indian films of all time. Twelve of the films in which Khan has acted in have accumulated nett gross earnings of over ₹1 billion (US$15 million).[7][8][9][10] He is the only actor to star in the highest-grossing Bollywood films of ten separate years.[11] Khan topped the Forbes India charts for 2014, in terms of both fame and revenues.[12] According to the Forbes 2015 list of Top-Paid 100 Celebrity Entertainers in world, Khan was the highest ranked Indian with 71st rank with earnings of $33.5 million.[13]</p>

In addition to his acting career, Khan is a stage performer and an active humanitarian through his charity non-profit organisation, Being Human.[14] Khan's off-screen life is marred by controversy and legal troubles. His tumultuous relationship with Aishwarya Rai, his hunting of endangered species, and a negligent driving case in which he ran over five people with his car, killing one, have been extensively covered by the Indian media.[15] For the last of these, Khan was sentenced to five years' imprisonment in 2015, but was later acquitted.[16][17][18] On 5 April 2018, Khan was convicted in a blackbuck poaching case and sentenced to five years imprisonment.[19][20] He was let out from Jodhpur jail on bail on 7 April.[21] The hearing is now scheduled for 7 May 2018.[22]</p>

1989–93: Debut and breakthrough
Khan made his acting debut with a supporting role in the 1988 film Biwi Ho To Aisi in which his voice was dubbed by someone else. His first leading role in a Bollywood movie was in Sooraj R. Barjatya's romantic family drama Maine Pyar Kiya (1989), one of India's highest-grossing films.[35][36] It earned him his first nomination for a Best Actor at Filmfare, but the much expected Filmfare Award for Best Male Debut was awarded to Sooraj Barjatya.[37]</p>


Maine Pyar Kiya was later dubbed in English as When Love Calls, a 125-minute version, which was the biggest hit in the Caribbean market at Guyana and also dominated the box office collections in Trinidad and Tobago. Maine Pyar Kiya had also been dubbed in Spanish as Te Amo, the first experiment of its kind. This 125-minute film also proved its universal appeal with a glorious 10-week premiere run at Lima, capital of Peru. In Telugu as Prema Paavuraalu, it crossed 25 weeks at Visakhapatnam and had a 100-plus day run at six centres in Andhra Pradesh.[38] It was also dubbed in Tamil as Kaadhal Oru Kavithai and in Malayalam as Ina Praavukal.

1990 saw one film release starring Khan; Baaghi: A Rebel for Love, a box office success,[39] followed by three moderately successful films in 1991, Patthar Ke Phool, Sanam Bewafa, and Kurbaan. In the same year, Khan co-starred with Sanjay Dutt and Madhuri Dixit in the Romance drama film Saajan.[40] The movie was a critical and financial success.[41][42] Despite these early successes, nearly all of his 1992–1993 releases resulted in box office failures.[41]

1994–2009: Hum Aapke Hain Koun..!! and other films

In 1994, Khan appeared in Rajkumar Santoshi's Andaz Apna Apna, co-starring Aamir Khan. At the time of its release, the film failed at the box office but has gained a cult status over the years. He returned to success later in the year with his second collaboration with director Sooraj Barjatya in the romance Hum Aapke Hain Koun..! co-starring Madhuri Dixit. During the 1995 awards season, the film won 3 Filmfare Awards for Best Film, Best Director and Best Actress. It also won the National Award for being the most popular film of the year.[43] Earning over ₹1.35 billion (US$21 million) worldwide, the film became the biggest Bollywood hit of the year. It is one of the films on Box Office India's list of "Biggest Blockbusters Ever in Hindi Cinema".[44] This film turned out to be one of Bollywood's highest-grossing films ever, becoming the fourth-highest earner of all time.[45] The film broke all the previous records and maintained itself as the highest-grossing Bollywood film throughout history for 7 years. In 1995 he starred in Rakesh Roshan's Karan Arjun alongside Shah Rukh Khan, Karan Arjun is an upbeat Bollywood musical, with religious overtones and action. The film was released on 13 January 1995. The two played brothers who are reincarnated after being killed by family enemies. The film was the second biggest hit of the year, and his role of Karan once again put his name among the nominees for the Best Actor award for Filmfare Awards.[46]

In 1996, Khan performed in two movies, Sanjay Leela Bhansali's directional debut Khamoshi: The Musical, a box office failure,[47] but critically acclaimed.[48] and Raj Kanwar's action hit Jeet.[47] He had two releases in 1997: Judwaa and Auzaar. The former was a comedy directed by David Dhawan where he played a dual role of twins separated at birth and was a commercial success, while the latter, an action thriller was "below average".[49]

Khan worked in five different films in 1998, his first release being the romantic comedy film Pyaar Kiya To Darna Kya opposite Kajol, one of the biggest commercial successes of that year.[50] This was followed by the moderately successful drama Jab Pyaar Kisise Hota Hai[41] where Khan played a young man who has to take a child who claims to be his son, under his custody. Khan's performance in the film earned him several positive notices and favourable reviews from critics.[51] He rounded off the year with an extended cameo in Karan Johar's directorial debut, Kuch Kuch Hota Hai, for which he earned a second Filmfare Award under the Best Supporting Actor category.[52]

In 1999, Khan starred in three films: Hum Saath-Saath Hain: We Stand United and Biwi No.1, (the two highest-grossing films that year)[53] and Hum Dil De Chuke Sanam alongside Aishwarya Rai and Ajay Devgan, which earned him another Best Actor nomination at the Filmfare awards.[54] The film was a critical and commercial success[53][55] along with its music.

In 2000, Khan acted in films including Har Dil Jo Pyar Karega and Chori Chori Chupke Chupke, which addressed the issue of surrogate childbirth; Khan played the role of a rich industrialist who hires a surrogate mother after his wife becomes infertile. Critics noted his turn towards a more serious role, which reportedly had more substance in comparison to his previous roles.[56][57] In 2002 he starred in the delayed release Hum Tumhare Hain Sanam.

For Tere Naam, (2003) Taran Adarsh said of him, "Salman Khan is exceptional in a role that fits him to the T. He breathes fire in sequences that demand uneasiness. But beneath the tough exterior lies a vulnerable person and this facet in particular comes to the fore in the latter reels. His emotional outbursts are splendid..."[58] Tere Naam is to date considered Salman Khan's best film with a critically acclaimed performance.[59][60] He subsequently continued his success at the box office with comedies like Mujhse Shaadi Karogi (2004) and No Entry (2005).[41] Khan's work in 2006 included Jaan-E-Mann and Baabul, however neither of these films were successful at the box office.

Khan started 2007 with the ensemble film Salaam E Ishq. His next release Partner performed well at the box office.[61] He next appeared in the Hollywood movie, Marigold: An Adventure in India which told the love story of an Indian man and an American woman. Khan starred in three films throughout 2008, all of which underperformed.[62]

Khan hosted the second season of the game show 10 Ka Dum in the year 2009, which turned out to be even more successful than his first season as host in the year 2008. The show got very high TRPs for Sony Entertainment Television and according to reports, the show helped Sony TV regain its third position in the Indian television ratings.[63]</div>
